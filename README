LISA

1. What is it?
--------------

Lisa is an application for keeping personal finances in a postgresql database.
The concept revolves around the simplest possible transaction line, where you have to enter as little information as possible, while still getting the most out of it.

The application has support for stocks (investing and trading) and it's also possible to maintain a budget.

2. Extra features
-----------------

All monitoring and graphing of data is done with Pentaho Reporting studio.
These reports are included in the bi section, with a custom setup for everything related to the reporting component.

A trading journal is also an extra application, that is still in development.
