:Description: Extra documentation on cfd's for lisa.

Notes
=====
Table t_trade might need extra fields, this will be checked in detail in
this analysis.

Margin
=======
Initial margin
--------------
Initial margin requires a margin percentage that can differ per cfd.
e.g.: For BE, it's usually 10%, but exceptions are possible.

Maintenance margin
------------------
The maintenance margin is calculated on the realtime course.
It's not possible to keep this information in lisa.
The percentage is usually twice as high.

Information
------------
Though there are exceptions, it's still a good idea to keep that information
available. We can use it to make sure that our positions do not get
liquidated.
A good solution would be to look at the following page:
http://www.whselfinvest.com/nl/CFD_Market_Information_Sheets.php?sheet=1
and use these general values.

Margin info in database
~~~~～～
We can conclude that we need to store these values from that link in the
database.
This gives us 2 things to implement:
- init script needs the values added in T_PARAMETER
- code needs to retrieve the correct value, based on market and country
- code needs to calculate the estimated maximum required margin:
  margin_estimated_max as both an absolute number and a percentage of the
  pool_at_start

T_TRADE
~~~~~~
Add columns
margin_estimated_max
margin_estimated_max_percent

Conclusion
----------
We need to make sure that we have enough margin, but it's difficult to keep
how much exactly. Estimations will be built in.

Overnight holding of cfd's 
===========================
Overnight costs
-------------------
When you hold a long cfd overnight, you get an additional cost:
    (overnight Libor + 3%)/360

Note: the 3% and 360% is a solid amount.

Problem: THe overnight Libor rate changes daily.
Solution: don't care about this too much, your total costs are commission +
tax, the difference will be the other costs.

Information
--------------
Those other costs will have to be saved in the database?
Attention, when shorting, those costs will be negative!
TODO: check if the calculations

Spread
=======
Important note
~~~~~~~~~~~
The spread is not a cost that goes off your account. It's an extra course
action you need to undergo in order to be profitable.
