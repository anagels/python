\section{Performance charts}
\subsection{Performance bars}
\begin{verbatim}
Total income from pool:
(1300/35000)*100 = 3.71%
With 1300 = total passive where acc = binb00
          <> total passive
With 35000 = sum(acc.rx where acc = binb00)
           <> networth

Total income from exp.:
passive_expenses
(1300/12000)*100 = 10.83%
with 1300 = total passive
with 1200 = total exp.
passive_safe_expenses
(1000/12000)*100 = 8.33%
with 1000 = total passive where acc = binb00
passive_safe_expenses
(1300/22000)*100 = 5.91%
with 22000 = total theor. exp. (incl. safety margin)
passive_safe_expenses_safe
(1000/22000)*100 = 4.55 %

Make 4 graphs under each other, with the evolution for 5 years:
graph1: passive_expenses per year
graph2: passive_safe_expenses per year
etc.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Expenses}
\subsubsection{Expenses per product}
Expenses per product = ok

\subsubsection{Expenses per year}
Expenses per year in graph = crossover

\subsubsection{Expenses per product per year}
Expenses per product per year: small graph per product
=> this can give detailed info on the evolution of expenses.
Downside is that you need to add a new graph each time you add a product.

\section{Progress charts}
\subsection{Progress of expenses}
Progress of expenses vs passive income = crossover
When both lines cross, FI is reached.
=> add active income to the list
This can give some interesting insights in the influence of actively earning money on the FI status.
=> make extra graphs, like with Performance charts 1
Don't put everything in 1 graph, put 2 or more smaller graphs under each other.

\section{Status charts}
accounts per year = what happened in that year to the different accounts
total net worth for a specific year
